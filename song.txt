What doesn't kill you
Makes you wish you were dead
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper
And I can't take
One more moment of this silence
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the world's getting harder to hold up
-------------------------------------------------------
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down?
Save me from myself
Don't let me drown
